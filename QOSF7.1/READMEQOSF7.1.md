This implementation takes advantage of the fact that Grover's algorithm can be used to solve unstructured search problems, such as finding the maximum of two signed integers. The input integers are first converted to their binary representation, which determines the number of qubits needed to represent the input.

The oracle function is designed to flip the sign of the target state if and only if the first input integer is greater than the second input integer. This is accomplished by applying an X gate to each qubit if the first integer is greater than the second, followed by a series of controlled-U1 gates that apply a phase shift to the target state. Finally, the X gates are applied again if the first integer is greater than the second.

The diffusion function is a standard operation that amplifies the amplitude of the marked state. It is applied repeatedly for a number of iterations that depends on the input parameters and is determined by a formula derived from Grover's algorithm.

The result of the algorithm is obtained by measuring the qubit that encodes the sign of the target state and returning the appropriate input integer.

This implementation is valid for all kinds of signed integers because it relies only on their binary representation and does not assume anything about their magnitude or sign. The number of qubits required to represent the input depends only on the number of bits needed to represent the largest magnitude of the two input integers.
